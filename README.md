# My Personal Project

## Expense Tracking Manager

My non-trivial classes:
- X; types of **expenses** (ie phone bill, rent)
- Y; individual's **collection of expenses** to pay

*What will the application do?*

Track and goal-set monthly expenses by taking in one's earning. The user will 
create an 'expense' assigned with its allocated goal-set/expected spending amount entered by the user.
The user can also enter amount spent on an 'expense' into the application and get an updated balance screen
on the application showing a list of the remainder of goal-set amount the user should be spending every expense. 
Overtime the user can access statistics on actual spent amount on certain expenses in comparison to goal-set values.

*Who will use it?*

Anyone who wish to goal set and track expenses.
This application will help the user achieve financial awareness.

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

To be more financially aware is something I wish to improve on in University.
