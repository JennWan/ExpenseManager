# My Personal Project

## Expense Tracking Manager

My non-trivial classes:
- X; types of **payments** (ie phone bill, rent)
- Y; individual's **collection of payments** to pay

*What will the application do?*

Track and set monthly expenses by taking in one's earning and 
creating custom 'payments' with assigned percentage/amount of earning.
(This will be the 'expected/set' amount user should spend on that 'payment' monthly).
The user will also enter real-time spending into the application and get updated amount
on the application showing remainder of earning to allocate. Overtime
get statistics on actual spent amount on certain 'payments'/a chart visualizing
actual spending versus set spending.

*Who will use it?*

Anyone who wish to set and track expenses.
This application will help the user achieve financial awareness.

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

To be more financially aware is something I wish to improve on in University.
