# My Personal Project

## Expense Tracking Manager

My non-trivial classes:
- X; types of **expenses** (ie phone bill, rent)
- Y; individual's **collection of expenses** to pay

*What will the application do?*

Track and goal-set monthly expenses by taking in one's earning. The user will 
create an 'expense' assigned with its allocated goal-set/expected spending amount entered by the user.
The user can also enter amount spent on an 'expense' into the application and get the updated balance.
Overtime the user can access statistics on actual spent amount on certain expenses in comparison to goal-set values.

*Who will use it?*

Anyone who wish to goal set and track expenses.
This application will help the user achieve financial awareness.

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

To raise more awareness regarding finances. I believe this application would be a beneficial
first step for individuals to incorporate awareness into day-to-day lives including myself.
This is especially of interest to me, as I will have to learn to budget and pay for my own expenses away from home, 
where almost everything is new.
